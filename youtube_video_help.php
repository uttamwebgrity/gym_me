						      <h1>How To Add a YouTube Share this video link to Your Web Site</h1>
						      <p>Now, embedding a video onto a web page becomes as easy as cutting and pasting. When you visit a site that hosts videos, such as YouTube, you are presented with a video box on the page. You can watch the video directly on the page, or the Flash player allows you to view the video full screen, just by clicking a button on the player. How much does it cost you to add a video from YouTube to your site? Nada--nothing. They provide the service, and they also provide the bandwidth, so the video is hosted on their servers and uses their bandwidth! Hard to beat a deal like that!</p>
                              
                              <p>Here's an example of a YouTube video that is directly embedded into this page.</p>
                              
                              <p><iframe width="80%" height="400" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LwP8G5ot-kg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>How do you do it? When you locate a video you'd like to add to your page from YouTube, look below the "Share this Video" link, by clicking on that very link you can copy the link of that video.</p> 
                              <p><img src="images/youtube_video.jpg" style="width:70%;" /></p>
